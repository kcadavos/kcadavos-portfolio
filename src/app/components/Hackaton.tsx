          I joined <strong>Team Liquid Logic</strong> to compete in the <em>San Joaquin County H20 Hackathon</em>, where we tackled a challenge focused on sustainable water usage.
          Our goal was to design a solution that helped households upgrade to more efficient appliancesâ€”within their budget and with clarity.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Over a fast-paced weekend, I participated in the <strong>ideation</strong>, <strong>feature design</strong>, 
          and <strong>UI prototyping in Figma</strong>. We built a  web app prototype that blended AI-driven guidance with real-time data to empower users.

        <div className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Our Idea:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Barcode & Image Scanner:</strong> Detects home appliances to assess water usage and efficiency scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Dashboard:</strong> Real-time visualizations of potential water + cost savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade & Rebate Engine:</strong> Personalized upgrade plans with incentives based on budget.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Chatbot:</strong> Conversational assistant offering water saving tips and answers.</li>

          Out of <strong>25+ teams</strong>, we proudly took home <span className="font-semibold">3rd Place</span>. 
 It was a proud moment that reinforced my passion 
          for meaningful, practical tech.
